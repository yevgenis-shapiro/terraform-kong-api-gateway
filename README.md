Kong API Gateway is a cloud-native, platform-agnostic, scalable API Gateway distinguished for its high performance and extensibility via plugins. It also provides advanced AI capabilities with multi-LLM support

✅ Advanced routing, load balancing, health checking - all configurable via a RESTful admin API or declarative configuration.
✅ Authentication and authorization for APIs using methods like JWT, basic auth, OAuth, ACLs and more.
✅ Proxy, SSL/TLS termination, and connectivity support for L4 or L7 traffic.
✅ Plugins for enforcing traffic controls, rate limiting, req/res transformations, logging, monitoring and including a plugin developer hub.
✅ Plugins for AI traffic to support multi-LLM implementations and no-code AI use cases, with advanced AI prompt engineering, AI observability, AI security and more.
✅ Sophisticated deployment models like Declarative Databaseless Deployment and Hybrid Deployment (control plane/data plane separation) without any vendor lock-in.
✅ Native ingress controller support for serving Kubernetes
